Welcome to Split Linux. In addition to your containerized identities, these two
users are available to log into the host system:

	- root
	- anon

If the file _host/password holds a valid password in encrypted form, it will be
set for these accounts. Otherwise their password defaults to "voidlinux".

The `anon` user additionally has `sudo(8)` permissions to run any command
without a password.


When logged in with root permissions you may use this command to add a new Void
Linux container/identity:

        create_voidlinux_container <name> <id> [musl]

If you omit the "musl" option the container is created as glibc. This looses
you some coolness-points, but causes more applications to work properly.


Thanks for using Split Linux. It's an honor to have you!
